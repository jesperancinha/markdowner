# project-signer

This project serves the purpose of automatically signing all projects from the root

The idea is to use something like:


```text
java -jar project-signer.jar -p <root_path> -l <label_text_to_replace>
```

To summarize, this program will scan all your readme files and standardize name. You may want a generic signature in all your projects and this little runner will do just that!

Stay tuned for more
